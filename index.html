          <h2>What is Reiki?</h2>
            <p>Since its beginning in Japan, Reiki has been adapted across varying cultural traditions. It uses a technique commonly called palm healing or hands-on-healing. Through the use of this technique, practitioners believe that they are transferring "universal energy" through the palms of the practitioner, which they believe encourages healing.</p>
            <p>A Reiki session usually is between 60 and 90 minutes in length. The session is performed by using specific Reiki hand positions by a Reiki practitioner or master. During a session, the client is fully clothed while comfortably reclining on a massage table or seated in a chair. A Reiki session may help ease tension and stress and may help support the body to facilitate an environment for healing on all levels- physical, emotional and spiritual.  A session is pleasant and relaxing and is most often utilized for one’s own personal wellness.</p>

          <p>My clients are each on their own path, and the core commitment of my practice is to their connection with that path. They are passionate about life, and bravely curious about the unknown inside each of them. My clients and I are drawn together to explore through a process of physical listening, feeling and exchange..</p>

          <p>The capacities I engage in this process include a customized combination of services based on my understanding of your strengths and needs. Treatments include active energy work and balancing, as well as building space and practice for individual rituals to maximize the benefits of our work together.</p>

          <p>In person services include Reiki, breathwork, chakra balancing, crystal therapy, and intuitive healing. Location specific services include room clearing, meditation space and altar design.  Our practice development work can include authoring daily mantras and affirmations, and self healing through breathwork, meditation, and Reiki.</p>

          <p>My training history includes Reiki initiation at <a href="http://www.maharose.com" target="_blank">Maha Rose</a>, first and second levels of Reiki Healer Training with the Dr. Usui Method, Shamanic Reiki training under Jonathan Hammond at Help Yourself Brooklyn, and massage therapy training at Southwest Institute of Healing Arts. I volunteer my time providing Reiki treatments at the Center for Health and Healing in the Department of Integrative Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital, Carriage Birthhouse, and local Women’s spaces. My location specific work is informed by my extensive work in textiles and fashion.

          <p>"I received my first treatment from Reiki Practitioner; Christina Lovely and immediately felt its healing effects.  Christina began by engaging me in deep relaxation.  With her powerful, gentle touch I could feel vibrations and heat radiating from my body at points of contact.  During this quiet meditative state, the flow of energy was drawn from my body.  After my session, I felt cleansed and rejuvenated.  I can’t explain why, but I felt stronger and taller in stature.  I had a sense of balance and peacefulness.  I highly recommend that you experience a session with Christina."</p>
          <cite>Dena Quilici</cite>
          <br>
          <p>"I recently had my very first Reiki treatment from Christina Lovely. I didn't have a particular physical ailment to address, but was experiencing regular feelings of being over worked, run down and mildly sore from springtime workout binges. The relaxing techniques in Tina's treatment did great things to refresh my energy and build strength in much more than just a physical way which, for me, was the biggest surprise. 
          Reiki had a way of planting me on a more stable physical ground by giving my mind a place to relax, reorganize and soar a little bit. When we began, my brain was full of chatter... albeit excited and happy to be trying Reiki. Once we were underway, the places I went were beyond my control. It was a short journey I needed to take, but didn't know it. I left the session feeling full of mental and physical energy, enthusiasm and peace. Only a skilled guide could have brought me there! Thank you, Tina!"</p>
          <cite>Orianne Cosentino</cite>
          <br>
          <p>My youngest client described her Reiki experience by saying, "I felt relaxed when I laid on the table. I could feel the heat from your hands and when it was done I felt like a beautiful fairy."</p>
          <cite>Olivia, age 4</cite>
          <br>
          <p>"Wow, what an amazing experience. I felt so invigorated and relaxed during and after my Reiki treatment with Tina. My treatment was exactly what I needed after a stressful few weeks to help clear my negative thoughts and helped me centre myself. I would highly recommend Tina's Reiki sessions to everyone. Non invasive and 100% incredible. I'm looking forward to my next session."</p>
          <cite>Caz Little, Dashing Hounds Stylist and Personal Shopper</cite>
          <br>
          <p>"Recently I decided to have my first Reiki experience, and a close friend of mine referred me to Tina. Going into the session, I wasn't 100% sure what was going to happen but I was very open to the experience, the healing, the stress relief and of course the relaxation. From the moment I walked in, Tina was wonderful. She has a calm and soothing aura. Knowing it was my first time, Tina explained how it worked and we got to it. Immediately I felt a release of energy lying on the table, and throughout felt warmth and heaviness as the stress left my body. I would recommend Reiki to anyone, and I'll certainly be going to see Tina again."</p>
