          <h2>What is Reiki?</h2>
            <p>Since its beginning in Japan, Reiki has been adapted across varying cultural traditions. It uses a technique commonly called palm healing or hands-on-healing. Through the use of this technique, practitioners believe that they are transferring "universal energy" through the palms of the practitioner, which they believe encourages healing.</p>
            <p>A Reiki session usually is between 60 and 90 minutes in length. The session is performed by using specific Reiki hand positions by a Reiki practitioner or master. During a session, the client is fully clothed while comfortably reclining on a massage table or seated in a chair. A Reiki session may help ease tension and stress and may help support the body to facilitate an environment for healing on all levels- physical, emotional and spiritual.  A session is pleasant and relaxing and is most often utilized for one’s own personal wellness.</p>

          <p>My passion for Reiki began as a rediscovery of my love for bodywork, after the birth of my daughter.  The calming effects of Reiki on my own body and mind helped me access a deep and heightened state of meditation.  I decided to expand on my Reiki education at <a href="http://www.maharose.com/" target="_blank">Maha Rose</a> in Brooklyn, under the guidance of Lisa Levin and Erika Spring.  Through Reiki, I discovered an inner peace I had not previously experienced, and am now eager to bring this into the lives of my clientele.</p>

          <p>In my previous life, I studied modalities in Ayurveda at the Aveda Institute and became an aesthetician.  I eventually transitioned into massage therapy at the Southwest Institute of Healing Arts, where I gained insight into so many wonderful avenues of the healing world.</p>

          <p>My skill sets of Ayurvedic balance, massage, and now Reiki have allowed me to truly provide the most in-depth and well-rounded bodywork to my clients.  I constantly strive to expand my knowledge in the pursuit of providing clients with the best possible care and help my client reach a state of enlightenment.</p>

          <p>"I received my first treatment from Reiki Practitioner; Christina Lovely and immediately felt its healing effects.  Christina began by engaging me in deep relaxation.  With her powerful, gentle touch I could feel vibrations and heat radiating from my body at points of contact.  During this quiet meditative state, the flow of energy was drawn from my body.  After my session, I felt cleansed and rejuvenated.  I can’t explain why, but I felt stronger and taller in stature.  I had a sense of balance and peacefulness.  I highly recommend that you experience a session with Christina."</p>

          <p>"I recently had my very first Reiki treatment from Christina Lovely. I didn't have a particular physical ailment to address, but was experiencing regular feelings of being over worked, run down and mildly sore from springtime workout binges. The relaxing techniques in Tina's treatment did great things to refresh my energy and build strength in much more than just a physical way which, for me, was the biggest surprise. 
          Reiki had a way of planting me on a more stable physical ground by giving my mind a place to relax, reorganize and soar a little bit. When we began, my brain was full of chatter... albeit excited and happy to be trying Reiki. Once we were underway, the places I went were beyond my control. It was a short journey I needed to take, but didn't know it. I left the session feeling full of mental and physical energy, enthusiasm and peace. Only a skilled guide could have brought me there! Thank you, Tina!"</p>

          <p>My youngest client described her Reiki experience by saying, "I felt relaxed when I laid on the table. I could feel the heat from your hands and when it was done I felt like a beautiful fairy."</p>
          <cite>Olivia, age 4</cite>
          <br>
          <p>"Wow, what an amazing experience. I felt so invigorated and relaxed during and after my Reiki treatment with Tina. My treatment was exactly what I needed after a stressful few weeks to help clear my negative thoughts and helped me centre myself. I would highly recommend Tina's Reiki sessions to everyone. Non invasive and 100% incredible. I'm looking forward to my next session."</p>

          <br>
          <p>"Recently I decided to have my first Reiki experience, and a close friend of mine referred me to Tina. Going into the session, I wasn't 100% sure what was going to happen but I was very open to the experience, the healing, the stress relief and of course the relaxation. From the moment I walked in, Tina was wonderful. She has a calm and soothing aura. Knowing it was my first time, Tina explained how it worked and we got to it. Immediately I felt a release of energy lying on the table, and throughout felt warmth and heaviness as the stress left my body. I would recommend Reiki to anyone, and I'll certainly be going to see Tina again."</p>
