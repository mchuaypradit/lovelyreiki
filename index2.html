        <h2>What is Reiki?</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="column small-12 content">
          <p>Reiki is a form of alternative medicine developed in 1922 by Japanese Buddhist Mikao Usui. Since its beginning in Japan, Reiki has been adapted across varying cultural traditions. It uses a technique commonly called palm healing or hands-on-healing. Through the use of this technique, practitioners believe that they are transferring "universal energy" through the palms of the practitioner, which they believe encourages healing.</p>
          <p>A Reiki session usually is between 60 and 90 minutes in length. The session is performed by using specific Reiki hand positions by a Reiki practitioner or master. During a session, the client is fully clothed while comfortably reclining on a massage table or seated in a chair. A Reiki session may help ease tension and stress and may help support the body to facilitate an environment for healing on all levels- physical, emotional and spiritual.  A session is pleasant and relaxing and is most often utilized for one’s own personal wellness.</p>

          <p>My passion for bodywork started with the desire to have a career where I could continuously learn and explore my natural and hidden talents as a healer.  I first started as an aesthetician, studying modalities in Ayurveda at the Aveda Institute.  The concept of balance between the mind, body, and spirit proved to me that through self care, one can maintain a more balanced system of self.  From there, it was a natural transition into the practice of massage therapy.  I studied this craft at the Southwest Institute of Healing Arts, where I gained insight into so many wonderful avenues of the healing world. I acquired a set of skills that helped my clients release built up and toxic energies in both body and mind, allowing them to develop to their fullest potentials.</p>

          <p>I re-discovered my love for body work many years later, after having my daughter, an experience that reconfirmed to me that practicing bodywork was the best path to connect with my own soul and make me feel truly centered. I felt the calming effect Reiki had on my own body and mind as I was finally able to access a deep and heightened state of meditation.  This led me to begin my studies at Maha Rosa in Brooklyn, under the tutelage of Lisa Levin and Erika Spring. This new skill allows me to help others in a way that made so much sense to me.  Through Reiki, I have discovered an inner peace that I had not yet experienced, and am able to share and bring its strong influence into the lives of my clients.</p>


          <p>My skill sets of Ayurvedic balance, massage of all types, and Reiki have allow me to truly provide the most in depth and well rounded bodywork to my clients. It is a combination that is soothing and healing, while allowing my clients to access their fullest inherent power. It has taught me far more than I expected and has connected me with amazing people who have furthered my growth and realize my intuitive potential.I constantly strive to expand my knowledge in the pursuit of providing my clients with the best possible care.</p>
